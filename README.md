NOTES ABOUT THE CODE:
This game was made in Processing. Therefore, although the language is in Java, many of the functions are from
library that comes with Processing and the compiler also comes with Processing. Therefore, much of the code 
will contain functions that are not typically used or seen in many Java programs. The functions that were used
can be seen on the Processing website.

This game was made in conjunction with three other people for a "Gamejam" competition. This game won 1st place.
